This repository contains the files that implements the solution, 
run_analysis.R, for the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data 
course on Coursera.

## The R script ##
## ------------ ##
The R script, run_analysis.R, is the script that implements the solution 
for the course project. 

The script should be placed at the same level of the unzipped "UCI HAR 
Dataset" folder.

To run the script, you have to have the working director set at the 
folder where the script and data set folder is located. Then use source 
function in R to source and run the script.

The script will generate a text file named, tidyData.txt, which 
contains the result dataset that is submitted for the project and meets 
the principles of:
	1. Each variable forms a column.
	2. Each observation forms a row.
	3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## The Code Book ##

There is a file named Codebook.md which contains the sutdy design
carried out while implementing the solution and a code book section
which describes the variables of the tidy dataset that is produced
by the run_analysis.R script.
